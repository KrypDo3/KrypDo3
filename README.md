**Exploring, breaking, and securing — from code to networks.**

## About Me

I’m a hobbyist developer and vulnerability analyst with a passion for Linux, Python, and network security. My work blends curiosity with a security‑first mindset — exploring software from both the builder’s and breaker’s perspective to better understand and strengthen systems.

I’m not here to chase trends; I’m here to learn, experiment, and share what I discover along the way.

## Philosophy

Security isn’t just about finding flaws — it’s about understanding systems deeply enough to make them stronger. I believe in continuous learning, responsible disclosure, and contributing back to the community that makes open‑source possible.
